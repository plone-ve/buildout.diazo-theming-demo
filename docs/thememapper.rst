Thememapper for Diazo
=====================

thememapper
===========

This is a theme editor for Diazo. This theme editor differs from the one found in Plone; it is a stand-alone application. It does require Diazo to apply the XML ofc!

It is still a work in progress. No file browser, no support for external webpages / themes. If something works; awesome. If it doesn't; too bad.

thememapper.core
----------------

If you want to map your themes by pointing and clicking you can use ``thememapper.core``. ``thememapper.core`` Is, like ``thememapper.diazo``, a stand-alone application and
does not require ``thememapper.diazo`` to run. For more information please refer to the readme file of ``thememapper.core``.

thememapper.diazo
-----------------

This is a stand-alone application that runs a developement Diazo server. This means it is not fit for production!. For more information please refer to the readme file of ``thememapper.diazo``.

How to use thememapper
======================

After the installation you will be able to run thememapper.core through the commandline::

    $ ./bin/thememapper --port <port>
    
For more options just run::

    $ ./bin/thememapper --help
